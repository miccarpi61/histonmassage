        <h1>ðŸŒ¿ Hello, Iâ€™m Jan! ðŸŒ¿</h1>
        <p>Welcome! I'm thrilled you're here. As a massage therapist, Reiki practitioner, and running coach, my passion lies in helping people find balance, wellness, and vitality through mindful touch and movement. My journey wasn't always rooted in wellnessâ€”I spent years living a sedentary lifestyle until a transformative shift guided me toward movement, natural healing, and reconnecting deeply with nature.</p>
        <p>Today, I embrace a barefoot lifestyle, outdoor adventures, and a diet enriched by real, whole foods. These experiences inform and enrich my practice, allowing me to blend scientifically supported techniques with holistic approaches that cater uniquely to you.</p>
        <p>Whether you're an athlete training intensely, someone just discovering the joy of movement, or anyone in between simply seeking greater comfort in daily life, I'm dedicated to meeting you exactly where you are. My personalized sessions range from deeply relaxing massages to targeted deep tissue work, and for those seeking an extra layer of rejuvenation, I offer Reiki energy healing as part of your therapeutic experience.</p>
        <h2>âœ¨ Why Choose to Work with Me?</h2>
        <p>I deeply value the healing power of mindful, compassionate touch.</p>
        <p>Each session is thoughtfully individualized to ease pain, foster relaxation, and enhance your overall movement and well-being.</p>
        <p>My approach resonates with everyoneâ€”from dedicated athletes to spiritually attuned individualsâ€”because I believe that profound wellness often begins with small, meaningful steps.</p>
        <p>If you're curious about how massage therapy or Reiki can support your unique journey toward health and vitality, please reach out. I'm here to answer your questions and accompany you as you cultivate a deeper, more harmonious relationship with your body.</p>
        <p>In support of your journey,</p>
        <p>Jan</p>
