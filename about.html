    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Hello, I’m Jan!</p>
    <p>I’m a massage therapist, Reiki practitioner, and running coach with a passion for outdoor activities and holistic wellness.</p>
    <p>My approach blends science-backed techniques with holistic healing practices. Whether you're seeking relaxation, pain relief, or improved movement, I tailor each session to your individual needs.</p>
    <h3>Why Work With Me?</h3>
    <p>I understand the profound healing power of touch and the importance of a mindful connection between body and mind. My sessions are designed to help with pain relief, relaxation, and enhancing movement.</p>
    <p>Whether you're an athlete recovering from intense training, someone focusing on energy healing through Reiki, or just looking to improve your general well-being, I believe in the power of natural healing.</p>
    <p>If you're curious about how massage or Reiki could help you, feel free to reach out or book a session. I look forward to working with you!</p>
