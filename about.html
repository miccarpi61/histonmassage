        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p> Hello, I’m Jan! 

I’m a massage therapist, Reiki practitioner, and running coach with a passion for outdoor adventures, barefoot living, and fueling my body with real, whole foods. My personal wellness journey began when I transitioned from a sedentary lifestyle to one filled with movement, natural healing, and a deep reconnection to nature. This transformation is what drives my passion to help others experience relief, recovery, and a healthier relationship with their bodies.

My approach blends science-backed techniques with holistic healing practices. Whether you’re an athlete preparing for a big race, a beginner exploring movement, or someone simply looking to feel better in your everyday life, I offer customized sessions to meet your needs. From relaxing massages to deep tissue therapy, I also integrate Reiki energy work for a deeply rejuvenating experience. Every session is designed to help you feel lighter, more relaxed, and more in tune with your body.

✨ Why work with me?

I understand the profound healing power of touch and the importance of a mindful connection.
My sessions are tailored to help with pain relief, relaxation, and enhancing movement.
Whether you're an athlete or someone focusing on energy and wellness, I believe in the power of small changes to lead to a healthier, more vibrant life.
If you're curious about how massage or Reiki could help you, feel free to reach out or ask any questions. I’d love to connect and support you on your journey to feeling better, inside and out!</p>
